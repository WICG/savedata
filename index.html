  The <cite>Save Data API</cite> enables web applications to access information about the user's preference regarding data savings.
</section>

<section id='sotd'></section>

## Requirements and use cases

This document describes an API that addresses a specific requirement: Communicate the user's preferences regarding data savings through both a JS API as well as a Client Hint.

**Example use cases:**

* A web application which primary purpose is to stream media could provide highly compressed media content if the user is interested in reducing their data costs.
* A web application presenting the user with background videos can choose to use background images instead, based on the user's preference.


## <dfn>NavigatorNetworkInformation</dfn> interface

The <code><dfn data-cite="!netinfo#network-information">NetworkInformation</dfn></code> interface exposes access to <a>saveData</a> by mixing in <a>NetworkInformationSaveData</a>.

<pre class="idl">
  interface mixin NetworkInformationSaveData {
    [SameObject] readonly attribute boolean saveData;
  };

  NetworkInformation includes NetworkInformationSaveData;
</pre>

  ### <dfn>saveData</dfn> attribute

  The <a>saveData</a> attribute, when getting, returns `true` if the user has requested a reduced data usage mode from the user agent, and `false` otherwise.

  <p class="note">The user may enable such preference, if made available by the user agent, due to high data transfer costs, slow connection speeds, or other reasons.</p>

  #### <code><dfn>Save-Data</dfn></code> Request Header Field

  The <a>SaveData</a> [[!CLIENT-HINTS]] request header field consists of one or more tokens that indicate user agent's preference for reduced data usage.

  <pre class="nohighlight">
    Save-Data = sd-token \*( OWS ";" OWS [sd-token] )
    sd-token = token
  </pre>

  This specification defines the "`on`" `sd-token` value, which is used as a signal indicating explicit user opt-in into a reduced data usage mode (i.e. when <a>saveData</a>'s value is `true`), and when communicated to origins allows them to deliver alternate content honoring such preference - e.g. smaller image and video resources, alternate markup, and so on.

  If <a>Save-Data</a> occurs in a message more than once, the last value overrides all previous occurrences.

  <div class="issue">
    TODO: update <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetching">Fetch#fetching algorithm</a> to use `connection.saveData` as signal to append the Save-Data header.
  </div>
</section>


<section data-link-for="NetworkInformation">
### Handling changes to the user preference

When the user's <a>saveData</a> preference changes, the user agent MUST run the <dfn>steps to update the user preference</dfn>:

  1. Let <var>new-saveData</var> be the current <a>saveData</a> preference.
  1. If <var>new-saveData</var> is not equal to the value of `connection.saveData`:
    1. Using the <a data-cite="!HTML#networking-task-source">networking task source</a>, <a data-cite="!HTML#queue-a-task">queue a task</a> to perform the following:
      1. Set `connection.saveData` to <var>new-saveData</var>.
      1. <a data-cite="!DOM#concept-event-fire">Fire an event</a> named `change` at the `NetworkInformation` object.

## Privacy Considerations

This specification exposes information regarding the user's preferences, which a bit of information about the user and can be used as an active fingerprinting vector.
User agents implementing this specification need to be aware of that, and take that into consideration when deciding whether to enable the feature in certain situations.

For example, user agents may decide to omit or lie about the user's preference when the user is in a private browsing mode.

## IANA Considerations

The following three HTTP request header fields should be added to the permanent registry of message header fields (see [[!RFC3864]]), taking into account the guidelines given by HTTP/1.1 [[!RFC7231]].
